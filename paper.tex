\begin{abstract}
  This thesis takes a look at SMPC especally using SCALE-MAMBA. For that it introduces first what SMPC is,  how SPDZ the precessor of SCALE-MAMBA works and what are the differences. It discusses the functionalities of SCALE-MAMBA, especially the split into online and offline phase, how the beaver tripels are used for sacrificing and in which complexity classes the calculations are done. Finally it compares scale mamba shortly to other competitors in the market and gives an outlook what next technologies are coming right now and are coming in the near future in SMPC.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation and Introduction}\label{sec:intromoti}
a)	Motivation: 
-	There are a lot of computations that have to be done in a distributed environment in todays technologies and in the future
-	Not possible to have all the information in one place anymore
-	Sometimes hard to know who to trust 
-	Problem: want to compute something together but we don’t want to share our information
-	A lot of use cases: number of distributed environments is climbing rapidly; for example see crypto currencies (distributed block chain; no one can do something alone, everyone relies on everyone else (or at least on a majority of the other participants)
-	A lot of research. Right now more theoretical than practical works; a lot of computational overhead
-	Scale-Mamba: 
o	Developed by a research team of the KU Leuven
o	Implements a lot of the theoretical foundations
o	Crypto suit, end to end
o	Possible to be safe against corruption with abort
o	Good (compared to others) execution times
o	Improvement of before existing technologies (SPDZ especially, and others)


b)	Structure:
This thesis will try to give an overview over Secure Multiparty Computation, especially focusing on Scale-Mamba and all the technologies it builds upon. Therefore, it will explain the basic technologies first in an abstracted manner and later go more into detail.

\subsection{Adversary types}
Cryptography is the science of protecting information or communication from an adversary. This adversary is normally a third party that wants to get information for his own gain or want to sabotage something because of his own interest. In the are of SMPC we we normally divide between two types of adversaries. In SMPC we expect that everyone but ourselves can be controlled by an adversary.  That means the adversary can control between one and all of the other parties with which we are communicating. The difference to the normal cryptographic adversary model is, that the adversary is one of the parties we are communicating with but not a third party that tries to intercept communication.
\subsubsection{Honest but curious}
This type of adversary tries to gain as much information as possible. But this adversary is obeying to the rules of our protocol, that means it is impossible to know that this party is controlled by a third entity. This adversary tries to retrieve some of the secret information from the other parties, by using all the information he gets during the execution of the protocol.

\subsection{Malicious adversary}
While this adversary also wants to gain all the information, he is not obeying to the rules of the protocol. This type of adverary can send different inputs to manipulate the results he receives. Furthermore, he wants to interrupt the whole protocol. That could mean making the computation impossible, but as well modifying his own input or his own calculations, so the final result is changed and might lead to different implications

It is important to decide between these two types of adversary, because it shows the different securities SMPC has to guarantee. It has to guarantee that no information is unwillingly shared with an illegal party and at the same time verify that the final result has a correct value.


Maybe move this behind the basic introduction of SMPC? Some parts like access structures 



\section{SMPC Basics and History}\label{sec:smpc}
\subsection{Beginnings}
As we saw in the introduction, there are a lot current and much more upcoming usecases of calculating the output of a function in a distributed environment with multiple parties while at the same time keeping all the individual inputs secret. The first explorations in these fields started in the 1970s, with theoretical problems like the mental poker problem(how can two players play poker while not being in the same physical location and making sure noone is cheating) and Yaos millionaire problem(how can can two millionaires decide who is richer than the other while not revealing their wealth). \newline
These explorations lead to a group of basic protocols which established the area of Secure Multi-Party Computation(SMPC).

 Now we will take a short look on the two most famous of these protocols, which both were the basis for a whole family of algorithms established in the years to follow until today.

\subsection{Yaos Garbled Circuit}

Most MPC protocols fall into one of two broad categories: garbled circuits,
and linear-secret-sharing-scheme-based (LSSS-based) MPC. The garbled-circuit
approach, which began with the work of Yao [38], involves some collection of
parties garbling" a circuit to conceal the internal circuit evaluations, and then
later a single party or a collection of parties jointly evaluating the garbled circuit.

 
\subsection{Shamirs Secret Sharing Scheme}

LSSS - linear secret sharing scheme

By contrast, the LSSS-based approach involves using a so-called linear
secret-sharing scheme, in which the parties: share" a secret into several shares
which are distributed to different parties, perform computations on the shares,
and then reconstruct the secret at the end by combining the shares to determine
the output. LSSS-based MPC is traditionally presented in the context of
information-theoretic security, although many modern practical protocols that
realise LSSS-based MPC often make use of computationally-secure primitives
such as somewhat-homomorphic encryption (SHE) [25] or oblivious transfer
(OT) [32]. In this paper, we focus on computationally-secure LSSS-based MPC.


\subsection{Terminology}
Over the years different terminologies came up in the are of SMPC. Following will be a short introduction into some of them, so their definitions are clear.

\subsubsection{Oblivious Transfer}

\subsubsection{Access structures}
There are a lot of different use cases for SMPC, so of course the adversary model changes depending on the system, the security needs, and the amount of parties involved. it is important to differentiate between these different use cases, because the different needs have big implications for security measurements that have to be taken and for runtime complexity. SMPC should run as fast as possible, while still providing all the neccesary security guarantees.

To describe which party has which rights, and how many parties can be corrupted so the security can still be guaranteed, access structures were introduced.
An access str 
d qualified set.  An access structure is called \(Q_l \) if at least l+1 parties are needed to  form a qualified set. 
An (n,t)-threshold scheme with t<n/l means that at least t+1 parties are needed to form a qualified set. Here, n is the number of total parties, and t is number of possible adversaries while not revealing any secrets.
A full threshold scheme means that all parties are needed to form a qualified set. This implies, that, if all other parties except one are corrupted by an adversary, this one party can still rely on the fact that it secret remains secret. Of course this has a huge impact on overhead and performance, but in some cases it can give needed security guarantees. That means a full threshold scheme is a (n, n -1) threshold scheme. (???: IS THIS CORRECT???)


An access structure for a set of parties denes which subsets of parties are
allowed to discover the secret if they pool their information. Such quorums of
parties are often called qualied sets of parties. An access structure is called Q`
(for ` 2 N) if the union of any set of ` unqualied sets of parties is missing at
least one party. We discuss this in some detail later, but for now the reader can
think of an (n; t)-threshold scheme where t < n=` which is where a subset of
parties is qualied if and only if it is of size at least t + 1. Computationallysecure
LSSS-based MPC has recently seen signicant, effcient instantiations
for full-threshold access structures [7, 23, 25, 32], which is where the protocol is
secure if at least one party is honest, even if the adversary causes the corrupt
parties to run arbitrary code (though this behaviour may cause the protocol to
abort rather than provide output to the parties). In the threshold case similar
effcient instantiations are known, such as the older VIFF protocol [21] which
uses (essentially) information-theoretic primitives only.

\section{SCALE-MAMBA}\label{sec:scalemamba}

\subsubsection{Overview}

In the last years, the research in SMPC is constantly ongoing, and there are new approaches or improvements to old approaches appearing regulary. But most of these publications only focus on a small area of the whole picture. SCALE-MAMBA is a project that tries to combine the state of the art research into one system. That means, that it is offering kind of an end-to-end system for SMPC.
It is a research system that is continously in development, therefore, there is not a single final version that can be examined. It offers as well a wide range of protocols for different usecases, i.e. it is possible to use the system in different confidurations. That also means for this thesis, that there is not a single process that can be examined. Therefore, this thesis tries to give more an overview how the process works in general, which are the main, especially which are newest and best, parts and where are the problems and bottlenecks.
 
In general, the protocol is split in two parts, first an offline phase and secondly and online phase. In the online phase only the final evaluation of the function is executed. In the offline phase, prior to the online phase, preparations are done by all the parties to prepare for the evaluation. This includes already calculating values for possible multiplications and MACs, so that the online phase can be executed faster. This phase is not completly offline, because the parties still exchange some information which are later needed for the evaluation. But this phasae is not that time critically, that means it can be already executed a lot earlier than the online phase, so that, when the function evaluation is really needed, the result can be calculated in a rather fast time compared to a system that still has to set up everything.

While SCALE-MAMBA also offers different access structures, the most commonly used security configuration is active security with abort in a full threshold scheme, that means that every except one party could be corrupted, and still no information is leaked, because the evaluation is aborted.



Actively Secure
Additive Shares: 



\subsubsection{Offline phase}

-basic idea
-beaver
-SPDZ
-scale-mamba
-further improvements?
- communication chanels during the offline phase

A. First improvement with MASCOT
using OT for triple generation isntead of SHE

B. Overdrive/TopGear
Improving SHE -> This gave a lot of needed push to SPDZ

In the many iterations of the SPDZ like protocols, there were different ways to guarantee that the parties are not cheating. In one of there earlier works, BDOZ, pairwise MACs were used to authentificate the secret sharing between the parties. It used a pairwise multiplication protocol with linear homomorpic encryption. To guarantee the data integritym pairwise zero-knowledge proofs were used, in total O(n2) of them. 
In SPDZ instead of HE, SHE was used, reducing the amount of ZK proofs per triple by a factor of n and as well the overhead per triple, because they used a single ZKPoK for proving thousand of triples.


\subsubsection{Beaver triples}

Beaver triples 

a,b, c=ab
1.e = Open([x+a]
)2.d = Open([y+b])
3.[xy] = [c]+e[y] + d[x] –ed

o	Why necessary? Easily able to write own configurations for SMCP for SCALE-MAMBA
c)	Idea, Computational Logic

Scale-Mamba is an implementation of SPDZ among other protocols. SPDZ is right now the most efficient protocol in use. 

Most LSSS-based MPC protocols split the computation into two parts: an of-

ine phase, in which parties interact using expensive" public-key cryptography
to lay the groundwork for an online phase in which only cheap" informationtheoretic
primitives are required. The online phase is where the actual circuit
evaluation takes place. For the access structures considered in this work, namely
Q2 structures, the offline phase is almost as fast as the online phase. Thus the
goal here is to minimize the cost of communication in both phases.

-	Online  Offline phase
-	Offline phase:
o	Calculation of beaver triples
o	Precalculations like MAC?
o 	Offline phase based on Overdrive protocols (before Mascot)
		Low-Gear: For smal numbers, O(n to the power of 2), faster than O(n )
		High-gear: For high numbers (for SCALE-MAMBA: Only high gear is implemented)

-	Online phase:
o	Secret sharing

SPDZ  Secret  Sharing.This  SPDZ  protocol  [15]  processes  data  using  an  authenticated  secret  sharingscheme defined over a finite fieldFp, wherepis prime. The secret sharing scheme is defined as follows: EachpartyPiholds a shareαi∈Fpof a global MAC keyα=∑i∈[n]αi. A data elementx∈Fpis held in secretshared form as a tuple{xi,γi}i∈[n], such thatx=∑ixiand∑γi=α·x. We denote a valuexheld in such asecret shared form as〈x〉. The main goal of the SPDZ offline phase is to produce random triples (〈a〉,〈b〉,〈c〉)such thatc=a·b. If we wish to denote the specific value on whichγiis a MAC share then we writeγi[x].

o	Sacrifice of triples to check calculation results
o	Check for adversaries (MAC?)
o	Abortion
-	Options/ Configurations:
o	It is possible to use different setups, depending on the taste of the user
d)	Performance, real world usage, problems, upcoming developments, 
-	Upcoming: Calculating offline data before, and then compiling the Mamba code just in time (especially full threshold access structures need a lot of time)




\section{Comparison}\label{sec:comparison}


a.	What else is out there?
b.	Different use cases – when which SMPC tool is more useful; what are the strengths of SCALE-MAMBA compared to other ones?
c.	Factual comparisons

SCAPI
SCAPI is an open-source Java library for implementing secure two-party and multiparty computation protocols (SCAPI stands for the “Secure Computation API”). It provides a reliable, efficient, and highly flexible cryptographic infrastructure.

\section{Outlook and Conclusion}\label{sec:outlook}

a.	What brings the future in general in SMPC?
b.	SMPC is a technology that will shape the future (at least a bit)


a.	SCALE-MAMBA is amazing
b.	We saw how it works in which cases it is more useful
c.	We saw why SMPC is necessary; we saw that we need it (or at least we should use it)



\section{TODO LIST}\label{sec:xxx}


Format: 
Your report should have a minimum length of 15 pages LNCS Style, excluding references. 
Your report has to include references, but they do not count towards your total page limit. The 'literature list' is the list of references. 

Try not to write more than 20 pages unless you feel you have a very good reason. 

Template: 
The LNCS is template is available for Latex [1] and Word [2] on the Springer page, 
but I suggest you use this quick start version [3]. 

How to correctly include references in your literature list: 

Please refer to e.g. the Chicago manual of style [5].

Any valid reference style is accepted, as there are many styles, and as they basically contain the same information. 



Next steps: 
I will send you instructions about the peer review process closer to the next deadline.



Best regards, Benjamin Heitmann.



-	Use Latex
-	Find examples/ empirical results
-	Gmw protocol – scapi library LSSR based, passive as comparison
-	Reusing results: maybe check in night for adversaries?
-	Could be nice to include reuse

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The remainder of the paper starts with a presentation of related work (\cref{sec:relatedwork}).
It is followed by a presentation of hints on \LaTeX{} (\cref{sec:hints}).
Finally, a conclusion is drawn and outlook on future work is made (\cref{sec:outlook}).

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

Winery~\cite{Winery} is a graphical \commentontext{modeling}{modeling with one \qq{l}, because of AE} tool.
The whole idea of TOSCA is explained by \citet{Binz2009}.

\section{LaTeX Hints}

\Cref{L1,L2} show listings typeset using the \texttt{lstlisting} environment.

cref Demonstration: Cref at beginning of sentence, cref in all other cases.

\Cref{fig:simple} shows a simple fact, although \cref{fig:simple} could also show something else.

\Cref{tab:simple} shows a simple fact, although \cref{tab:simple} could also show something else.

\Cref{sec:intro} shows a simple fact, although \cref{sec:intro} could also show something else.

Brackets work as designed:
<test>
One can also input backquotes in verbatim text: \verb|`test`|.

The symbol for powerset is now correct: $\powerset$ and not a Weierstrass p ($\wp$).

\begin{inparaenum}
  \item All these items...
  \item ...appear in one line
  \item This is enabled by the paralist package.
\end{inparaenum}

Please use the \qq{qq command} or the \enquote{enquote command} to quote something.
``something in quotes'' using plain tex syntax also works.

You can now write words containing hyphens which are hyphenated (application"=specific) at other places.
This is enabled by an additional configuration of the babel package.
In case you write \qq{application-specific}, then the word will only be hyphenated at the dash.
You can also write applica\allowbreak{}tion-specific, but this is much more effort.

The words \qq{workflow} and \qq{dwarflike} can be copied from the PDF and pasted to a text file.

Numbers can written plain text (such as 100), by using the siunitx package like that:
\SI{100}{\km\per\hour},
or by using plain \LaTeX{} (and math mode):
$100 \frac{\mathit{km}}{h}$.
